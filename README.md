## Overview

This is a tic-tac-toe game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, for two players where they take turns marking a 3x3 grid with X or O, with the goal of being the first to get three in a row

## How to play

Players take turns marking empty squares in the grid with X or O. The first player to get three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie. Use the "Reset Game" button to start the game again.

## Other names

Tic-tac-toe is also known as noughts and crosses in the UK and Xs and Os in Canada and Ireland.
